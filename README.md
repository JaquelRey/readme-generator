## Installation  
Clone this repository, and then navigate to it's root in your terminal. Make sure that you've got [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed as it's needed for the next step. In the command line, run the command ```npm install inquirer@8.2.4``` to install the Inquirer package required.  
## Usage  
Next, run the command ```node index.js``` to begin prompts. Type your answers, and press enter when you're done with each question.
